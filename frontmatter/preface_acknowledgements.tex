This template was created in response to a number of requests found on various online forums for a \gls{latex} book template. Answers to such requests frequently offer unasked advice (sometimes almost sounding like admonishments for posting such queries) instead of providing  what was requested: a book template such as this. That being said, it is evident there are myriad considerations when putting together a book, let alone doing so in \LaTeX. No template could hope to address even a small fraction of those considerations in the detail that ultimately may be needed. Nevertheless, having a place to start can be beneficial to the novice. Who knows? An experienced \LaTeX\ author might even learn something by reviewing this material. But as it stands, this template is merely a starting point that may lend itself to an interesting foray into more extensive authoring. \vspace{3\parsep}

I gratefully acknowledge the work of the following people for making even this modest project possible: \index{Knuth, Donald} Donald Knuth and \index{Lamport, Leslie} Leslie Lamport for creating the foundation upon which the whole structure stands; Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly for writing {\itshape Guide to \LaTeX}, from which I learned so much; Chandra Has for his excellent \LaTeX\ video series on YouTube; and the innumerable unsung heroes at projects like CTAN, \gls{tex}-LaTeX Stack Exchange, LaTeX.org, and other such websites, along with the developers who produce so much great code supporting the best software system for producing truly beautiful documents.
